/*
  Serial parse
  
  Demonstrates the use of the inbiult function, Serial.parseInt()
  
  As an example, two values seperated by a comma can be sent serially that gets 
  assigned to two different variable. These two variables will affect the ON and
  OFF time (in ms) delay of the blinking LED. If only one value is sent, then it 
  will get assiged to only first variable without affecting the second one. 
  
  This logic can be exteded to parse more than two values.  


  
  Connections:

  Uses the on-board LED connected to pin 13.
